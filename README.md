All of the cloud mechanisms work together seamlessly to deliver my application. The EC2 instances host both the backend and frontend of my application and communicate through the VPC network. I have used S3 to store images of hotels and resorts, and API Gateway to manage and secure my RESTful APIs. Additionally, I have implemented a serverless architecture using Lambda and SQS to automatically send emails to users. Secret Manager is used to securely store my MongoDB URI and API keys. Overall, this combination of cloud mechanisms provides a scalable, flexible, and reliable infrastructure to deliver my application.
### **AWS Services Used**

| Service | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `EC2` | To deploy my code on highly customizable virtual server |
| `Lambda` | To configure serverless archirecture that send the email to the users  |
| `S3` | To store the images of hotels and resorts and display it on web page  |
| `Virtual Private Cloud` | To provide a secure and isolated network environment to my application - configured subnets, scurity groups as well  |
| `API Gateway` | To create an API that takes the data from the backend and put it on AWS SQS  |
| `SQS` | To hold the message from the API Gateway that will trigger the lambda  |
| `Secrets Manager` | To store the API Keys, Mongo Credentials  |
| `DynamoDB` | To store the property details added by the users  |
